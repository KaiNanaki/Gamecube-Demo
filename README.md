# Gamecube-Demo

A video of the game demo and a few pages of code not covered by the NDA with Nintendo

Task: Develop a simple engine for the Nintendo Gamecube and create a short game to demo

Game: "King of the hill"

Goal: Reach the top of the "Hill" within the time limit

I was required to demonstrate:
1.  A working .ELF file compiled from Microsoft Visual Studio, displaying at least 1 3D model
2.	Correct use of vertex descriptors
3.	Model loaded from a file
4.	Moving model(s) (use of transformations) and using the controller meaningfully
5.	Moving camera position (handled properly)
6.	Lighting implemented and including specularity
7.	Texturing used, and correct configuration of the TEV (lighting and specularity applied to textures) 
8.	Collision detection and response
9.	Use of shadow(s) and transparency
10.	Using a HUD (on-screen display)
11.	Use of sound
12.	Using at least one self-created or imported asset (Model, texture or sound)
13.	Using mixed materials (textured and untextured)
14.	Use of a loading screen
15.	Implementing a “win condition” and a “fail condition” for the game
16.	Implementing a cheat to allow the win condition to be reached easily
17.	Code Quality: clarity (naming, comments, code layout)
18.	Code Quality: Good use of classes, object-oriented design
19.	Code Quality: Use of manager/slave classes
20.	Code Quality: Use of external text files to configure program
